replicate etch sketch game using python


[**Wikipedia:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) "Etch A Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy invented by Andr√© Cassagnes (Ecran magique, T√©l√©cran)(...). An Etch A Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line. The knobs create lineographic images. The left control moves the stylus horizontally, and the right one moves it vertically."

'w' = move forward
's' = move backward
'd' = turn clockwise
'a' = turn left
'c' = screen reset (shaking etch sketch üßö)
